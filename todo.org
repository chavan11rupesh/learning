** 1. compizconfigsettingsmanager -> effects->animations->focus animation->wave to set wave animations.
** 2. https://github.com/EliverLara/Ant#note to set Ant theme
** 3. to set default theme go to appearance -> theme -> ambiance(default)
** 4. to create new database commands=>
       1. sudo mongo db name --port port-no
       2. db.createUser({user: "gps", pwd: "inMbMZg2DM75", roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "db-name (for eg gps_v1_dev)"}]})
       3. edit  mongodb.conf uncomment auth=true
       4. also make changes in robo
       5. sudo service mongodb restart
